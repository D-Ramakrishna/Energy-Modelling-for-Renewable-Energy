To create a README file explaining the working of the energy_management function, you can follow a structured approach to describe its purpose, inputs, outputs, and the steps involved in the energy management process. Here's a template you can use:

Energy Management Function README
Overview
The energy_management function is designed to optimize energy management by determining how to allocate generated energy to meet demand while considering storage capacity and efficiency. This README provides an explanation of how the function works and the various components involved.

Function Inputs
Generation: An array representing the energy generated.
Demand Values: An array representing the energy demand.
Planted Capacity: The installed capacity for energy generation.
Battery SOC (State of Charge): The current state of charge of the battery, represented as a percentage.
Battery Efficiency: The efficiency of the battery, expressed as a percentage.
Function Outputs
The function returns a dictionary containing the following key components:

Demand Values: The input demand values.
Generation to Evacuate: Energy generated to meet demand.
Deficit Values: Shortfall in meeting demand.
Excess Energy Values: Excess energy generated beyond demand.
Cumulative Charge List: Cumulative energy stored in the battery.
Hourly Storage Results: Energy stored in the battery on an hourly basis.
Withdrawal from Storage List: Energy withdrawn from the battery to meet demand.
Storage Loss List: Losses incurred due to battery inefficiency.
Excess After Battery: Excess energy after considering battery storage.
Evacuated Post Charging List: Energy evacuated after charging the battery.
Final Loss List: Final energy loss after optimization.
DFR without Market Purchase: Dynamic Firming Ratio without purchasing from the market.
Loss 1 List: Energy loss due to capacity constraints.
Loss 2 List: Additional energy loss beyond capacity constraints.
Working Process
Efficiency Loss Factor Calculation: Calculates the efficiency loss factor based on battery efficiency.
Immediate Generation and Demand Relationships: Determines immediate generation and demand relationships.
Cumulative Charging Handling: Manages cumulative charging considering excess energy and demand.
Hourly Storage Changes: Calculates changes in battery storage on an hourly basis.
Withdrawal from Storage: Determines energy withdrawal from the battery to meet demand.
Storage Loss Calculation: Calculates energy loss due to battery inefficiency.
Excess Energy Calculation: Determines excess energy after considering battery storage.
Evacuated Post Charging Calculation: Calculates energy evacuated after charging the battery.
Final Loss Calculation: Computes final energy loss after optimization.
DFR Calculation: Calculates Dynamic Firming Ratio without market purchase.
Loss 1 Calculation: Calculates energy loss due to capacity constraints.
Loss 2 Calculation: Calculates additional energy loss beyond capacity constraints.
